		 		<P>The Ewoks are sentient furred bipeds native to the moon of Endor</p>
				<p>They are curious individuals that stand about one meter tall.</p>
				<p> They are extremely skilled in forest survival and the construction of primitive technology like gliders and catapults.</p>
				<p>They are quick learners when exposed to advanced technology,</p>
				<p> however. The Ewoks accepted members of the Rebel Alliance into their tribe, </p>
				<p>and allied themselves to their cause.</p>

				<p>The Ewoks helped in the ground battle to destroy the Imperial shield generator built in their forests,</p>
				<p> and their primitive weapons felled the stormtroopers and the scout walkers of the Empire.</p>
				<p>Their help paved the way to victory at the Battle of Endor.</p>
